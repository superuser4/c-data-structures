Some Data Structures and Algorithms written in C and Rust by me
## What this repo is about
This repo mainly exists for me to understand data structures and their implementations, as well as other CS students to take a look at how some of these fundamental data structures can be implemented. Most of the Data Structures in this repo are implemented in a very basic fashion for learning. Please let me know if you see any problems or any way to improve something!
